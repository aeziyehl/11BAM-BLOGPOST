For all the misery and hardships that come with it, there’s admittedly a beauty in human perseverance: how we keep pushing ourselves through tough times, not even knowing what comes next, nor whether it’ll be for better or worse. And yet, we try – either it succeeds, or it doesn’t – but nevertheless, we try anyway. And yet throughout my life, I have always struggled with trying things when I see no point doing so. Perhaps one of my biggest flaws is my tendency to neglect the things that I believe I cannot perfect. This has led me to fall short on so many projects and activities. But its not as if I don’t like doing them, I simply want whatever it is I do to be good and perfect.

Growing up, all I ever saw around me was perfection: perfect scores, perfect projects, and perfect everything. But they weren’t from me; they were all the work of my two perfect siblings. I’ve always wanted to be like them, and I thought I would, given enough time. I am the youngest after all. And yet as I grew older, I started growing closer to where they once were. But now that I’m here, I still feel like nothing has changed. After all this time, I’m just as much as myself as I always have. I’m still imperfect and make lots of mistakes, and as bad at time management as ever. 

Then I look up at my siblings and see that in that meantime, they’ve only ever reached greater and greater heights. It was confusing and discouraging to see just how far I really was from them. But in my confusion, I began looking for answers. I had to know what exactly I missed; what exactly I must do to be the perfect stars that they were. But as I looked back, the answer I found was not the one I was searching for. 

Looking back now, I realize that all I saw of them when I was younger was only ever the surface. I saw their medals and certificates, and the perfect results, but not the late nights, and all the stressful days that they went through. I saw all the praise and admiration they received, but never the quiet moments of doubt they must have felt but never showed anyone. And now I realize that all this time, I’ve mistaken their hard work and perseverance for effortless perfection. Maybe the reason why I’ve felt so far behind for so long was because I was comparing my messy, and unpolished drafts to their polished final outputs. And knowing this my respect for my siblings has only grown, and now I see them as far more incredible than I always believed them to be. They were never perfect nor were they flawless, but they kept going anyway, and that was how they achieved everything they did. And while that was not the answer I was looking for, I know now that that is the answer I needed all along.
