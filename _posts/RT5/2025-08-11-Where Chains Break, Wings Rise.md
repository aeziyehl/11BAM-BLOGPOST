When we were tasked to create a poster that represents our life, I decided to draw an image that was both personal and symbolic—a man with wings, broken chains at his feet, golden rays shining from above, and a dark, gloomy ground beneath him. At first glance, it might look like just a fantasy drawing. But to me, it is a visual representation of what it means to be human, created in the image and likeness of God, and what freedom looks like in my own journey. Every detail of this artwork carries meaning: the man represents us humans, the wings represent hope, the chains represent the burdens of sin, oppression, and ignorance that drags us from freedom, the golden rays represent divine light, and the gloomy ground represents the old self that I have risen above or in other words, change.

In my own life, there have been moments when I felt trapped. Not in a physical prison, but in my own limitations—mistakes I could not undo, fears I could not shrug off, and ignorance I was not even aware of at the time. These were my “chains.” They held me down, convincing me that I was not capable of change, that my situation would always be the same and would never get the chance to change. It was in these moments that I realized how heavy invisible chains can be.

But with time, consideration, and faith, I began to see a different truth. Like the figure in my drawing, I discovered that I could rise above those limitations. The chains did not have to define me; they could be broken. That moment of realization was a breakthrough, a moment of transcendence. I understood that being created in God’s image means I am more than my weaknesses. I am capable of reason, of love, of hope. And when I chose to rise, it was not just an escape from the past, but a transformation into someone new.

When I first faced challenges, I saw them from a narrow perspective. I focused only on the pain, the unfairness, and the things I lost. This partial view made me believe that I was powerless and merely weak. But as time passed, I began to see my life in a bigger picture. I realized that even in difficulty, there were people who supported me, lessons that formed me, and strength I gained from surviving hard times.

In my drawing, this is symbolized by the contrast between the gloom at my feet and the light above my head. At first, I only saw the gloom. But when I stepped back and looked at everything together, the past, the present, and the possibilities ahead I could see how the dark ground was not a place I was trapped in anymore. It had become part of my life, something that shaped me but no longer controlled me. Seeing my life holistically helped me understand that freedom is not about pretending the past never happened. It is about carrying its lessons with me while I move forward.

One of the most important lessons I learned from this journey is the difference between truth and opinion. There were things I used to believe that I thought were absolute truths such as the idea that I could never change, or that my value depended on other people’s approval. Those were just opinions shaped by fear, insecurity, and the voices around me.

It was only through honest reflection, prayer, and seeking guidance from people I trust that I began to see the truth: that I have dignity and worth because I am made in the image of God; that I have the freedom to choose, to grow, and to love. Letting go of false beliefs felt like breaking the last link in a chain. And in that moment, I experienced a kind of freedom I had never known before, not just freedom from something, but freedom for something: to live with purpose, to love without fear, and to seek what is good and true.

My artwork is not just a picture; it is my life, my journey, in symbols. The man is all of us—human, flawed, but capable of rising. The wings are hope—a reminder that even when life feels heavy, we can choose to fly toward something better. The chains are the sins, ignorance, and oppression that weigh us down, but the fact that they are broken shows that change is possible. The golden rays above are God’s light, guiding us when we choose truth and love. The gloom below is the past—still there, but no longer in control.

To be human in the image and likeness of God, especially in today’s world, is to live in that freedom. It is to remember that we are not just physical beings reacting to circumstances, but spiritual beings capable of reason, compassion, and hope. It is to choose truth over opinion, love over selfishness, and light over darkness. In the end, freedom is not simply breaking chains—it is becoming the person God always intended us to be.
