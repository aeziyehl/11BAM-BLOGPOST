Everyone tries to do good, they put themselves in an image in light that they are innocent, pure, and obey the will of the Lord. However, we always have a sin that ties us down to the depths of suffering. Whether it be short-term pleasure or a choice that harms others. Even I have fallen to that depth of low. I know I attempt to do what is good to rise, and achieve God’s will, oftentimes in random day to day events that I can’t even remember anymore. I am taught to exceed my limits when it comes to doing what is right in ordinance to His will. However, there are limitations I often face. However, this experience helps me learn something and allows me to exceed my limitations for the next time I catch myself in a situation. Every time I faced a situation it made me feel more than just body and mind. The situation allowed me to think more clearly knowing that I am more capable than such a result, able to see that I can have a deeper understanding.

Every time we view something we first see the worst or best side of it and not the full story, that is what my poster represents. We are presented an opportunity to do good and be accepted by the Lord. However, every time we do we end up being pulled back down by the chains that bind us in earth and hell. When I first looked at my own poster, I noticed that the angel that attempts to fly is being pulled down for their sins. That isn’t the case though, we are being held back not by our sins, the truth is when Adam disobeyed the Lord, the devil had tied us down. That’s why when others look at the poster, they see it as us being tied down by our sins, but no we are tied down by the sins that had been made, we were actually made to be in the kingdom of heaven. Looking at both views allows us to be more certain of what is happening and not have biases.

There are times when we believe that some things are true but are not, and just thoughts, opinions, choices, even I experienced that. I thought that by pretending to be someone else you can see how you yourself are, but it’s just an opinion, you get to know yourself in a different way. I figured that out when I pretended to be someone I wasn’t, it just burdened and burnt me out to the core. How I could discover myself is just by being true to myself. When you seek the truth instead of just following an opinion, you tend to understand and feel lighter both in the heart and mind. I felt it when I started being honest instead of lying about my certain interests and adorations in life. To conclude, we are held back by ourselves when we don’t seek enlightenment.
