I remember the time when I tried to impress someone, but I completely failed, so I was embarrassed the whole time as I walked down the hallway. I was embarrassed at the time, but when I tried it again, I managed to do it. However, at the same time, I didnâ€™t, because when I did, I slipped at the end and bumped my head on the ground.
I learned something from my experience: you don't need to impress someone who you're good at or not good at, because in the end, they will still find you endearing to hang out with, and they will still be happy to be with your side, no matter what happens.

From that moment, I felt grateful cause of the people who would look up to me, not just because of my body or my mind, it's the kindness and your personality that makes them comfortable being with you and have a capable of reasonable understanding of that person.

From my perspective, I saw myself as a clumsy person and sometimes emotionless at times, it depends on my mood if I wanna really be emotionless.
You know. Sometimes you really need not think about the things that are necessary in our minds and just forget them by distracting yourself with something that makes you comfortable.
In my partial point of view, i was really focused on looking for a person who would talk to me and hang out and i really thought i couldn't do it, but deep inside I knew I could, so i tried and tried and tried to make friends, and i did it by not just impressing them, but by communicating them
In my Holistic point of view, impressing is not the way to find someone whom you want to become close to, but it's through communication.

Sometimes yes, but technically no, cause how can you call it just opinions even if you really worked hard on that something you just did or with that specific person.
I really don't have any methods or processes that helped me evaluate what was in my situation, I just technically forgot about it and never think about it ever again, and just focused on my future with the people and the things I want to do.

By just really trusting yourself on your situation your having, but sometimes you need confidence on that specific situation, like for example, your friend is getting bullied by someone and your to scared to stop them cause you dont want to get involved from the bully, you need to be brave and be confident with yourself and defend your friend. Thats why trusting yourself, but rather than simply following opinions isnt the thing that can make you grow as a person, opinion is just like your mind is trying to distract you from that kind of situation your friend is having, opinion is just your mind trying to think that this is just a roleplay instead of helping your friend, your just thinking that this is just a roleplay that the person whos bullying my friend, or opinion is like your judging a person that right or wrong.
