I was once such a God-centered child. I lived my life serving the Lord, Him only. I served the church, the people, and the Lord. All my life was about Him. It was like I was created to serve Him. He blessed my mother with a child who was willing to do anything in the name of the Lord. That is until I reached my darkest point. The point in my life where I stopped believing in the Lord. He was once my whole world and suddenly I questioned my faith.

In such a difficult position, who wouldn’t ask help from the Lord? Who wouldn’t rely on the Lord? I prayed and prayed hoping He’d answer my genuine prayers. He did not. That is when I started questioning my faith. Is God really real? Does he actually make miracles happen? If He is real why is He not answering? These exact questions clouded my mind together with anxiety, confusion, sadness, pain, and anger. I felt so disconnected with the Lord that at that point, I just stopped believing.

One day came and that day hit me so hard. The realization that day hit me very hard that the emotions that clouded my own mind and heart vanished. I completely forgot about my purpose in life. I disregarded the Lord due to just one fall in life. I cut my connection off with the Lord due to my own foolishness and my ignorance. I recalled that everything just goes with God’s plan for you. I acted immature and evil towards God but He was still so good to me. Despite my actions, He still had it in His heart to treat me well. He gifted me with a miracle. It took a long time but the joy I felt when He answered my prayers was filling me. 

Although it wasn't just joy, it was joy together with guilt. That sense of guilt that makes you question, “Why would He still do this even after how I disrespected Him?” “Why would He still express His love for me after all that?” I questioned myself so much it led to me looking at the whole perspective of my situation. I learned that God made me go through this because He knows that I can get through this. Instead of having faith in the Lord, I disregarded His love for me, for us humans. I completely forgot what God was capable of doing. He is capable of bringing us joy, love, and hope.

His gift gave me hope. Hope that didn’t feel like any other. I started to live my life to the fullest. I stopped thinking about things that can sever my relationship with God. I stopped thinking negatively and started leaning unto the Lord. I reconciled with the Lord for my foolish actions. I have never been happier. The Lord will always be with us from the start, our creation, to our downfalls in life, to our redemption, until when we feel a slight of hope again.
