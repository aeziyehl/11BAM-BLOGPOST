Are there battles you fight alone? I know all your answers will be “yes”. There are wars we fight that no one else can see, the quiet conflicts inside our hearts and minds, combat against pride, envy, greed, and the endless stream of distractions that dull the spirit. This poster—my very own—will stand as my confession of this inner struggle. At its core is a man caught in a tangle of sharp thorns, representing the pull of temptation and the suffocating disarray of distractions. Surrounding it are broken icons of “Social Media”, symbolizing the modern times, where chaos and confusion slip through the cracks of pleasure and entertainment, trapping the soul when we proclaim it as a source of worth. Above it all is a hand of God, reaching down through the mayhem, and the name Yahweh shines like a trophy, reminding me of the fact that never alters: “That no matter how dense the thorns that’s binding me, the hand of God will always be extended to aid the hearts of the sorrow.”

This is not merely an art. It is a testimony of being pulled out of the shadows into a life guided by something greater than myself.

There was a time when I lived for what was facile, following immediate satisfaction. Endless scrolling, shallow validation, and the thrill of being known fed my ego and numbed my thoughts. I thought this was all harmless happiness. I thought I was just favored and spoiled, but in times of silence, an emptiness began to grow. It was a hunger that pleasure could never feed.

The journey of letting go was no easy feat. It felt like leaving home for a battleground, tearing a scab away from a wound, even if the pain was insufferable. Yes, it was grueling, but in that painful choice, I found a deeper kind of enlightenment. I realized I was not created just to survive, nor to be blinded by worldly possessions. I was made to grow, to choose what is right, even if it’s difficult, and to aim for something far greater than comfort. From that day forward, I swore to discover the person I was meant to be, for I know I am given the ability to rise above my limitations.

his was not just a mental decision. It was my spiritual awakening. I realized that I’m no more than just a body reacting to urges, but a creation in the likeness and image of the Lord, capable of loving, choosing, knowing what is right, and instilled with purpose. In my poster, the hand of God pulling the figure upward is this very moment—the surrender of my worldly desires to Him, recognizing that my life has meaning that no distraction can give and no temptation can take away.

The first time I decided to change, I was what they call “immature” because my perception and understanding of things were narrow and emotional. I only focused on the things I would lose—the excitement, the fun, the crowd's recognition. I used to believe “Everything that makes me happy now must be a good thing.” I admit that was my partial point of view—one that is immersed in temporary things without the consideration of the bigger consequences.

But when I stepped back and took a glance at my life from a wider picture, I saw more than just my emotions. I began to realize the weight of my habits. How it was shaping me into the person I’ve been avoiding. Someone restless, distracted, and spiritually weak. I realized the wickedness of my actions, the people I was neglecting, the moments I was missing, and the values I’ve forgotten.

By holding both views, my honest emotion and the bigger fraction, I found clarity and tranquility. The broken Icons of social media in my poster represent this shift. This is not a rebellion against technology itself; rather, it’s a warning. When we permit small pleasures to control us, we lose sight of what truly matters. Seeing life as a whole gave me the strength to choose what nourished my soul over what entertained it for a moment.

For years, I accepted that my worth is dependent on the outlook of others—their likes on my posts, their praises, and their opinions. It felt true because almost everyone seemed to live that way. But, it was never the truth, it was an opinion, shaped by the community around me, the culture built on comparison, and hierarchy.

I was changed by the slow, deliberate act of seeking something higher, following the truth. Through prayer, silence, and reading the Scriptures, I realized that my value comes from the Almighty God alone. It is constant, unshaken by numbers, opinions, or approval. In my poster, the open Bible and the glowing Eucharist are lights that reveal this truth. They represent the clarity that comes from seeking God rather than the shifting judgment of the people.

Seeking the truth rather than the verdict of others gave me freedom. Opinions lead you to blind obedience to things that will only break you. But truth steadies your steps. It teaches you to act from conviction, not from the fear of being left behind.

I now clearly see that life will always have thorns. Temptation, hardships, and pain are part of the journey. It is made to make me stronger, not signs of defeat. The thorns are not to destroy me, but rather, to remind me that I can never walk alone. The central image in my poster—-God’s hand pulling me upward, is a reminder that no matter how much pain I am experiencing right now will not amount to the happiness He has prepared for me. God will always be there to help, lead with grace, and bring hope.

My goal now is to live for what lasts, not for what fades. I vow to make choices centered in love, truth, grace, and rooted in a purpose greater than I. The applause of the world may be loud, but the calling of God is deeper and is the only one worth answering.

My poster is my journey. A story of struggle, surrender, and salvation. A tale of a soul once tattered with scars and tangled with distractions. But now, it is a beautiful tale about letting go and reaching for the hand that saves. A reminder that transcendence is not running away from the world, but living with a heart anchored in the truth.

The thorns will always be there, but so will the hand of Yahweh, and when it reaches for me—I will reach back, no matter how sharp the thorns are.
