This poster of mine is about the creation, fall, redemption and hope for mankind. It starts with God creating earth, and on the sixth day he made a man called Adam from clay or soil and from the image of God. God then made a woman named Eve to not make Adam feel lonely but from the following days a serpent tricked Eve into biting the tree of knowledge and gave it to Adam which began the fall of mankind. But God still loves us and gave us a chance to redeem ourselves and have the chance to go back to him. This poster of mine shows that we still have a chance to redeem and repent of our sins, to be with him forever.
There was a time in my life when I felt discouraged or couldn’t understand myself. I became isolated, afraid, and I began to distance myself from God. I just couldn’t understand what my purpose was on this earth, or why I was even born at all… I wanted to let it all out, but I couldn’t get it out of my mouth or express it. I keep on misbehaving, getting mad easily, disobeying my parents etc. That’s when a friend of mine told me that “it’s alright to feel this way, we are all just humans in the end, vulnerability is our weakness both mentally and physically.” And he told me to always go to church and seek guidance from God when you’re not feeling well in your current state, because he's the one who let all your problems wash away and guide you back to your path. That’s when it hit me that I haven’t been communicating to God. I was too blind to let God enter my mind and soul and helped me with my problems and worries. So, I went to church and prayed, I asked for guidance on what to do and how to overcome it and to take all my problems away from me and forget all about it. After that day, in the following days or weeks I seem to get better, as my mental health improved, I became more gentle, honest with myself, energetic and joyful. I finally understand what I was aiming for, and it is to always communicate or to connect with God more because he will help you no matter how difficult your situation is. This experience teaches me that I am more than just a human being, I can do things that could potentially excel my overall well-being to the fullest and overcome my anxiety, worries and problems if I seek guidance from God. 
At first, I see myself through emotions only. I was discouraged or felt disconnected. I only focused on my pain and fear, I didn’t even try to see myself clearly or understand why I was going through it. That’s when I reflected through my thoughts, emotions, faith, and the people around me, I finally understood myself clearly. I realized that my struggles were not meant to destroy me, but to guide me closer to God and to help me appreciate the value of faith, patience, and support from others. For me, both partial and holistic perspectives help me realize that my feelings are valid but not always true. But I could still gain experience and understand the situation more clearly. 


In that experience of mine, I was just completely alone and that I would never overcome this struggle of mine that I was weak. But I realized that those emotions are just opinions and not true. They are just distractions of myself giving me negativity. What helped me evaluate what was true was by praying, reflecting, and seeking guidance from people I trusted. Overall, It teaches me to be more patient and open to learning from experiences instead of being controlled by my immediate feelings.
