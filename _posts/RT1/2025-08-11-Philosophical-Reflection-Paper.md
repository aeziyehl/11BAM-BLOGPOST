Why do I feel the need to be more? What is there to hope for? These are the questions I
asked myself when I was down in the mud, when I felt like my whole world had no purpose. But
when I hit myself with these tuff questions, it strikes me back. These questions take me back when
I was just starting leadership training to become a boy scout leader in USJ-R. I was inspired by
there braveness, and the confident looks on their faces. So, I became one. Time passes, and now
I am on my 2

nd year of being a BSP Leader, and I was intrigued by a very important person in the
History of the USJ-R BSP unit and USJ-R itself, Sir Damazo. To me, he was the definition of the 12
laws in scouting. Inspired by his legacy, I saw what I needed to do, and what I needed to improve.
By continuing my BSP years, the experiences I have gained had taught me that I have the potential
to exceed my limitations. It taught me to be different, it taught me to rise above the problems
and to never be stagnant in my pursuit of improvement. At that moment, I felt that I was more
than just a student. I was a Josenian, a Pioneer in the 21st century, capable of thinking deeper and
understanding even the little details in life.

Before gaining these experiences, I viewed my life like it was just a linear line through the X axis.
I just wanted to live life, I felt no need to do more, and my emotions just felt happy and grateful
to be alive. My partial Point of View in Life was to grow up, make memories, and to hopefully
make a happy Family in the end to continue my legacy. But then I experienced all the hardships,
the struggles, and the problems in life. After this, I started to look at life at a bigger scale. Not just
focusing on my life, but at others as well. I collected my thoughts and emotions, and decided that
I want to improve myself, I wanted to continue being happy, I wanted to help others who are in
need of my help, like my Family, Friends, and even my schoolmates. I decided to bring smiles to
everyone who are sad. But to do this, I also needed to heal myself from the past wounds. Now,
considering both partial and holistic perspectives, it helps me understand every situation I am in,
and act on it more wisely.

As a Josenian, a pioneer, and a friend. I came to the conclusion to help myself improve from my
past mistakes, to never be stagnant, to consider other possibilities, and to help others in their life.
These experiences didn’t just help me realize what I wanted to do, it transformed me, like a
caterpillar coming out of its protective shell and becoming a beautiful butterfly. Because of these
different views, and perspectives in life, I am now a better version of myself. To end this reflection
paper, a quote from Baden Powell, the Father of scouting, fits my situation very well. And it is to
“leave this world a little bit better when I found it.
