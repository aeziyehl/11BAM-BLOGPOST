My CLF poster is about how we are created in the image and likeness of god. This means that we are meant to reflect his image of love, kindness, dignity, and so on. but I also showed how sin damages our image. The broken pieces in the poster represent the way sin hurts our ability to reflect God's image as we are supposed to do. It changes us that we are not able to reflect God's image.

In my life, I have experienced moments when I failed to love or do what is right, when I let sin guide me. sins such as being selfish, impatient, and angry. These moments make me feel bad and guilty, for example, there was a time where I spoke harshly to my friend because I was in a bad mood and I was very "pikon", and I saw how my words hurt them. That experience made me realize how easy it is to damage relationships and go against the love we are called to give to others. and I have also experienced times when I acted beyond my own wants, when I chose to forgive a certain someone who hurted me, but still chose to forgive because it was the right way. I chose to forgive instead holding a grudge, and be patient even if I was in a hurry. Those moments felt like I was living out my true purpose being able to reflect God's image. They reminded me that being human is not only getting our needs met, but also reaching something higher. I realized through church and my parents teachings that all material things in this world will all be meaningless when we die. Our purpose is to do our mission here on earth and go to heaven.

At first, when I looked at image of god only as a religious belief. but when I thought about it more deeply and reflect. I saw it from a bigger perspective. A limited or patial view might focus only on peoples faults and failures but a holistic views shows me that even if we are broken there is still hope. the gold lines in my poster, inspired the the japanses potter repair, shows how grace heals us. grace does not hide our flaws but it makes them part of something beautiful. this is true not just faith, but also in life. the challanges we face and the mistakes we make can make us a better person and improve if we learn from them. a mistake done alot of times is called a habit, and a mistake done once is a mistake.

this way of thinking also changed how I see human dignity. If I only judged people by their mistake, I would miss their value. and who am I to judge others when I myself am I sinner. I believe it is our nature as humans to commit mistakes as we learn from them. but when I remembered that every person carries God's image, I try my best to treat others with more respect and compassion even though there are people I hate but I also try not to hate because it is wrong. I also learned the importance of seeking truth. There were times I believed things that turned out to be only opinions like thinking people will never change. but I my self being a bad person before, change because I know it was wrong. I believed in change. and I though that my mistakes define me as a person. But looking for truth, instead of just accepting my thoughts and emotions, helped me grow. For example, listening to people's stories in life, I learned that people can overcome even deep struggles, and that grace can inspire change.

In the end, my poster is more than a project, its reflects my own journey as a person. the hand and light represents gods creation, the broken pieces shows how sin can harm and corrupt us, and the gold lines shows the healing power of grace. for me, the story of being human is this, we are created by gods image we inherit his image, hurt by sin, but be able to restore through grace which is basically love, truth, and choosing whats right. this understanding pushes me to see life in a better way. with hope, compassion, and the courage to grow and improve. it also challenges me to look at myself and the others not only for who we are now, but for who we can become when we allow grace and truth to help us in our life. one of the most important things I learned through out my life is that our mistakes does not define us but our actions in the future.
