I'm a person who is battling depression every day, I don't show it to everyone, even my parents because I'm afraid I might be judged, whenever I wake up, some things happen well, and some aren't, sometimes my thoughts get trapped in fear, sadness, and grief. Every day I always tell myself to keep moving forward and think that everything is going to be alright, when these moments arrive, I’ve learned one thing, which is that I can’t do it alone. That’s when I turn to God and let Him take over my struggles. 

Depression makes you feel helpless, like you’re soaking in your own opinions. I used to think that I had to fix myself before I could come to God so that he wouldn't get disappointed. But I’ve realized He wants me to be either a perfect or a messy person. He doesn’t expect me to carry my pain in silence. Instead, He asks me to let him gather your thoughts for him.

Letting God take over your bad thoughts doesn’t mean the heartache instantly vanishes. My struggles don't completely vanish overnight. But when I let Him into my pain, I feel something that transforms inside me. The voices of sadness in my head aren’t as loud as before because I've started to hear his voice reminding me, that I’m never alone and God will always be here for me whatever the damage is, it may be big or small, God helps me either way.

Throughout my days, my prayers weren't that long. Sometimes all I can say is, “God, help me.” And somehow, He grants it. Not always by changing my condition immediately, but by giving me the strength to make it through each day of my life. He makes me happy and grants me happiness, even with the smallest prayer, he always answers it, or even just the quiet peace that tells me I’m going to be okay eventually.

Depression makes my future look like a dark highway with no end, but I always remember that God reminds me that there is an end, and He’s already there waiting for me. I’ve learned that my pain is not destroyed in His hands. He can use it to make me stronger, more understanding, and more dependent on Him. God always sees me in my bed crying, every tear I’ve dropped was seen by Him. And every time I feel like giving up, He reminds me not to do it.

I’m still on this journey, slowly recovering and getting back on track. I’ve given my struggles to a God who is bigger than my depression. He carries the consequence when I can’t, and He fights for me when I’m too tired to fight. My story isn’t over yet, because God is still writing it and He’s not done with me. I always remember how god changed me into a better human being up to this day. Don't worry because God’s got this.
