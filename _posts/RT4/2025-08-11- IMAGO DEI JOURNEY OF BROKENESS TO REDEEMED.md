When I look at my piece of Imago Dei: Broken, Restored, Redeemed, I see more than just two hands reaching through a breach. I see my life story, my suffering, my hardships, and my development as a person.

The shadows on the left side is a reminder of who I was back then, someone who yearned for acceptance and every ounce of energy to prove myself to others. I'm becoming the person on the right, lit by light. I'm learning to get back up for me, not for the praise of others. My break occurred in the middle, but it was also the beginning of a greater change.


Last year was one of the most challenging times of my life. A relationship that I valued deeply ended because of my immaturity, and the person I loved and cared for moved on so quickly that it felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me. I still carry that hurt, like a shadow, and it consumed me. I became arrogant, self-centered, reckless. I tried to fill that hurt and void in all the wrong ways, rushing into a new relationship before I was even ready, and drowning myself in school work and extracurricular activities, all to prove her wrong. My revenge was loud, it was attention-seeking, wrapped in my obsession to appear "successful" in her eyes.

Looking back now, I recently saw this one tiktok about the story of Plato’s Allegory of the Cave, and it totally reflected my story. All I saw were shadows on the wall, my revenge, my pride, and my ego. Those shadows were lies I believed, like thinking my worth came from what she thought of me or from achievements that looked cool but it didn’t make me happy. I thought I was moving forward, but really, I was just chasing things that weren’t real.


That’s when things started to shift. In my poster, my life, golden threads run through the crack as a reminder that healing is possible even in hard times. I started to see better if I let light in between the gaps, like the liberated prisoner in the parable whose eyes gradually acclimate to the daylight. Not to please her, my parents, my instructors, or anybody else, I understood that I had to live for me.


I started small, resting when I needed to, speaking kindly to myself, and listening to people who truly cared. I also learned the difference between truth and opinion. I once believed, that if it were the truth, that my value depended on what others thought about me. But stepping into the light, it only revealed it was only an opinion born from pain. I realize now that the real truth is this: my worth comes from being made by God, from my ability to love, forgive, and begin again.

Then, transcendence isn’t about escaping my past or pretending those deadly wounds aren’t there. It’s about stepping out of the cave and returning to help not only others, but my future or old me find the light. The past sometimes still haunts me, but it no longer chains me from my past problems. The hands in my poster remind me there is always a step from above, a light that calls me out of the shadows.

Now, I move forward with a deep understanding of my values, my limits, and my purpose. I don’t want to rise out of pride anymore, but out of peace. My life isn’t defined by how others see me, but by how I choose to live, still broken, yes, but always being restored and redeemed.
