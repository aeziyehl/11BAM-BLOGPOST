Life is such an extraordinary yet complicated thing. An animation of you and many where each move turns to curved paths turning to different consequences. A mere existence of upholding your own dignity. So I take advantage of that. Excelling and working isn’t the only move to make in living. I try to do much more, such as dreaming big and ripping through that dimension with my rigid fingers in order to live that dream into a reality. 

Me, an aspiring child, so fond of art, still wants to live big without asking for pennies on the street, desiring to make me and my parents proud. So what did I do? I pushed that expectation off a cliff and carried that weight to turn it to an existence of my own. I hiked that hill and carried through my own interests without a noise rambling through my ear on how unrealistic my dreams were.

Such a breath of fresh air to go beyond what I knew I couldn't do. It made me understand the true capabilities hiding in my chest, waiting to be revealed to its full potential. I knew I could do so much more than live. Despite knowing I’m a sack with a brain and heart, I know that I’m much more than that. A spirit who feels and understands myself. A face of God. Before knowing all those points, I was solely pathetic. I didn’t understand anything and thought giving up was my only option.

“Do better than what you’re doing.” I thought. My tiny heart couldn’t grasp the thought of such.
Then another came up. “Life’s too short for you to waste it all on something useless”

I always thought negatively of what I wanted to do. But growing up gave me the chance to go beyond what I knew and see above it. I wasn’t aware the wall I looked above had an open space. I thought it ended with a roof. Turns out those dreams I wished I had were above a concrete screen waiting for me. That’s where I realized I had to break myself outside of that box to see what else there was for me. There was still a whole to a piece I’ve only discovered.

Turns out some puffed up thoughts like “Too many dreams won’t get you nowhere.” floating around my head were mere lies.
Although some can be true. “If you dream big enough, you’ll live it’s reality”. I know because others got to.live in that context. Although some couldn’t, I believe I can be the person to prove it.

There’s never enough to live life to its fullest. Opinions don’t shape a truth to its fullest. An opinion is an opinion and I live by that. Some may have their own thoughts, but I stand with my own. Orthodoxia, a religious term defining a ‘correct’ opinion, is something I can stand by. In a religious context, it is an adherence to a purported "correct" creed, but it can also still be more than that. For me, it can be an internal compass to my own truth. The Catholic Faith also teaches that truth isn’t just intellectual, but lived. That’s where I can fit in my personal perspective even within Catholic Orthodoxy, there is space to search for a truth personally. My truth doesn’t need to be loud, it only needs to be lived. And in that, I find my Orthodoxia.
