There is a quote from the previous prime minister of the UK Winston Churchill "We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender." This quote shows persistence and determination in the face of overwhelming adversity. To never give up even if overwhelmed and believing that I could not escape that predicament.

During the pandemic especially during my 7th grade I didn’t know at the time that I was severely depressed. No one to talk too online even if in real life still doesn’t help. There are many factors that caused this to happen, mainly there are 3 reasons why: my pessimistic view towards life, my unwillingness to socialize to other people especially online, and inability to time management. Currently as of writing this reflection that is still my darkest days of my life.  The things that brought me joy is coding or watching youtube since I was not allowed to play games because my parents want me to continue my honors. I’ll just lie that it's for my project for the computer subject so that I won’t be depressed to the point of leaving the earth. During those days all I want is to survive this ordeal alive. It showed me to change my view to an optimistic one, to be determined and patient even if I am surrounded on all four sides.  

When viewed from a limited perspective, my actions could be easily misconstrued. Someone looking at my behavior might be seen as lazy, not knowing the importance of education, ungrateful to my parents' sacrifices or a child that is simply incapable of handling problems. While some of this is true this doesn't show the reasons behind my behavior, the causes of it, it only showed the effects.When I include those my actions makes sense. It shows that it is essential to consider the two perspectives to be a wiser person. Using partial perspective I gain a clear understanding of the picture. Then by applying the holistic perspective, I know what is on the picture itself, the colors, the shapes and the perspectives used.

During that time I believed that I cannot escape this predicament and that I will continue to face it again and again until I graduate Junior High School. I was heavily mistaken, When I found out that face to face classes will be back I was ecstatic who won’t be. It is true since I have gotten it from the news and multiple news outlets support this claim and also the vaccine was administered to almost all the people of the country. When I seek more truth, not opinions. It helps me be self-aware of my surroundings and strengthen my values and integrity. These are especially important when AI content is on the rise. 

For me life isn’t worth living for when you have nothing to worry about, no problems to solve and no challenges to overcome. Like Churchill’s speech to never surrender, I found my own reason to fight, not on beaches, fields, seas and cities but with small acts of determination and patience each day. The hardest battles aren't found physically but mentally. By applying the two perspectives I learn to know the causes of my actions and the effect it has on me. It is essential to find out what is opinion or truth in these trying times especially when content can be created with a single click.
