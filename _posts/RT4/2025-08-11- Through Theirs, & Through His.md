There are moments in life when you feel like you’re standing at the edge of yourself—when your body says stop, but something inside mumbles, just a little more. I found myself in one of those moments during a tournament, drenched in sweat, gasping for air, and my body screaming at me to stop. Yet, I kept pushing forward. I wanted to win. But it wasn’t just about winning anymore; it felt like a test about myself. Looking back, that moment wasn’t about sports—it was understanding the deeper truth within us. 

The air felt heavy, my heartbeat was so loud it drowned out my own thoughts. I remember standing there, ready to perform, but all I could feel were their eyes—watching, judging, expecting. During training, my chest tightened, all I saw was darkness, my ears were ringing, my hands trembled, and a thousand thoughts crashed into my mind; they almost ate me whole. I realized shortly after that moment that I wasn’t just acting out of instinct or chasing victory. I wanted something far greater—validation. I wanted those watching to see me, approve of me, and silently say, You belong.

At first, my perspective on this experience was narrow. I only saw it as an internal conflict to push past my limits. I believed that winning or performing well would finally give me the satisfaction I longed for. But I was very wrong. My world at that moment was just me and their eyes, it was so suffocating I couldn’t escape. I didn’t think about anything else other than proving myself. The more I focused on how they saw me, the more I felt like I was on the line.

But when I later stepped back and looked at the bigger picture, I saw something more. My worth cannot be measured by their approval alone. Whatever they thought of me, my dignity will remain unchanged because it was given to me from the very beginning—being created in the image and likeness of God. The realization that no performance, success, or failure, can add or subtract from my value lifted the weight off my shoulders.

I also learned how to separate opinion from truth. Back then, I believed that people's perceptions were the ultimate measure of my own value. That was only an opinion—one that my past anxieties had augmented until it felt like reality. The truth, which I only came to see in the present, was that no amount of applause or silence could define me. Truth is unshakable, they say, while opinions shift with our own personal beliefs. Understanding this difference gave me the courage and strength to stop letting other people’s thoughts control how I saw myself.

The shift from being partially to holistically developed helped me understand my life with more wisdom. I still value recognition—it is human to want to be seen and appreciated, but now I know that it cannot be the center of my self-worth. The panic attack I once had became a turning point, a reminder that I am not just a performer under everyone’s eyes because I am created in God’s image, and no gaze and judgement can take that away.
