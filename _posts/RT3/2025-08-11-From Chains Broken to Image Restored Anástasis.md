As I look at my Imago Dei poster, I recognize that it is more than just art, I see my own story. On the left side, there are chains and cracks of sins, and it reminds me of a time I was in chains to my pride and anger. It happened when someone I really trusted betrayed me. My first reaction was to cut them off completely and convince myself I was just “protecting my own peace.” I thought my anger was justified and that staying mad somehow made me stronger.

Looking back, I realize that I was only focusing on the partial perspective of it. I saw myself as the victim and them as the villain. I didn’t notice how holding on to resentment was changing me, it was making me less patient, less compassionate, and honestly, less happy. I was letting my hurt and anger control my life instead of remembering who I am. I almost forgot that I am a person that is made in God’s image.

Over time, things started to change. With prayer, some advice from my good friends, and just thinking about God’s mercy, I began to see and understand the bigger picture and gain a new perspective. Being Imago Dei means reflecting God’s love, even to those who have caused me pain. The dove on my poster reminds me of the peace that comes when we let grace break the chains of our bitterness. I had to remember that forgiveness isn’t about pretending nothing happened, it is about letting go so I can live and be free.

That's when I learned to separate truth from opinion. My opinion before was that forgiving someone would make me look weak. However, the truth, which I now saw through faith and reason, is that forgiveness is actually strength. I saw it in people I admire who forgave even worse things. And this restores my dignity and allows me to act from love instead of hate and anger.

And I can now understand both sides, the pain that I experienced, and the fact that the other person is human too, with their own struggles and challenges. This whole perspective doesn’t get rid of what happened, but it allows me to deal with it with more wisdom and empathy. While this does not mean that we ended up becoming close again, but it does mean that I do not carry the same anger anymore.

My poster serves as a daily reminder that we are created good, we fall, but we can be redeemed through grace and hope, and with that, we can be restored. When we choose truth, rather than opinion, and love, instead of bitterness, we are not just surviving but we are living as the image of God we were created and always meant to be. In the end, I came to realize that living out the Imago Dei may not always be a one-time decision. It is a daily decision of how I will see with God’s eyes, act with His heart, and live life through faith, hope, and love.
