In my poster, the image of a person bound by chains at the bottom of a cliff represents the version of myself that was once weighed down by exhaustion, fear, and self-doubt. Those chains symbolize the unhealthy patterns I carried: pushing my body beyond its limits, ignoring its signals for rest, and believing that my worth was tied to constant achievement. Just like in my sport, I often told myself that stopping or slowing down meant weakness, so I kept climbing in pursuit of improvement, even when I was already close to breaking.

The darkness of the figure at the base of the cliff reflects how those beliefs overshadowed my true identity. I had convinced myself that the only way to be “enough” was to keep proving myself, often chasing the validation of others. Yet, even when I succeeded, the emptiness remained because I was searching for my value in the wrong places.

As the figure climbs the cliff in the poster, the chains begin to crack and break. This change mirrors the moments in my life when I started to question the mindset that kept me bound. Through both failure and reflection, I began to realize that true strength is not about enduring endless strain but about knowing when to rest, recover, and rebuild. I also recognized that my worth does not come from how much I can achieve or how perfectly I perform, but from something far deeper — from God, who gave me my worth before I ever earned a single accomplishment.

The gradual lightening of the figure’s shade as it climbs represents the transformation I am undergoing. This is not an instant change, but a process — one that involves letting go of fear, embracing rest as part of growth, and learning to trust in God’s plan instead of my own need for control. Each lighter step symbolizes a shift: from chasing human approval to seeking clarity from the One who knows me completely; from relying on my own strength alone to allowing grace to carry me forward.

Reaching the top of the cliff, the figure extends its arms toward a radiant presence — God. This moment in the image is my vision of transcendence: the ability to rise above limitations, not by escaping them, but by transforming them through faith. In my life, transcendence means accepting my weaknesses without letting them define me, and seeing them instead as spaces where God’s strength can shine.

From a partial perspective, I once viewed my challenges as proof that I was not enough — as if every setback confirmed my inadequacy. But when I began to see my situation from a holistic perspective, I understood that these moments were part of a bigger journey toward self-awareness, balance, and spiritual growth. My hardships were not barriers to my identity; they were shaping me into someone more resilient and more rooted in truth.

I have also learned to distinguish between truth and opinion. Opinions — both mine and others’ — told me I had to keep striving endlessly to be valuable. The truth, however, is that my value is constant because it comes from God. This truth has freed me from the tightest chains I carried, replacing them with hope, purpose, and peace.

Like the figure in my poster, I am still climbing. The chains are still falling away. I am not perfect, but I am moving toward the light — with determination, humility, and a trust that my worth and direction come from God alone.
