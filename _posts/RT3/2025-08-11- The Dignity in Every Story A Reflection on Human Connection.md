Life's a winding road, not a straight path. We stumble, we fall, and sometimes, the destination isn't what we envisioned. But within those unexpected turns lies the beauty of understanding and empathy. Respecting others, even when their viewpoints differ wildly from our own. I remember one time when I went with my family and other relatives to give food to homeless people in different towns. It was definitely outside my comfort zone. We drove around, stopping at different spots where people were living on the streets. It wasn't easy seeing people in such tough situations, but I felt like I was doing something important. I felt like I was aiming for something greater, trying to bring a little bit of hope and dignity to people who really needed it.

That experience taught me a lot about what people can do. Even though it felt like there was so much suffering, I saw people helping each other out and being really strong. It made me realize that we're all capable of more than we think. It's not just about what we can do on our own, but how we connect with others and try to make things better together. Being there, I felt like more than just my body and my mind. I felt connected to something bigger: a shared sense of humanity. It made me think about why things are the way they are and what we can do to make a difference. It gave me a deeper understanding of how we can use our minds and our hearts to help others.

At first, I was just focused on the immediate situation, the people who were hungry and struggling right in front of me. It was hard to see past that. I felt sad and a little overwhelmed.
But as I spent more time with the group and listened to people's stories, I started to see the bigger picture. I realized that there are a lot of reasons why people end up on the streets, and it's not always their fault. There are problems with society and the way things are set up. Seeing the whole picture changed my perspective. Instead of just feeling sad, I felt more determined to do something about it. 

Before going out to help the homeless, I had a lot of opinions based on what I'd heard. Some people say that homeless people are just lazy or that they're all drug addicts. I kind of believed those things, but I didn't really know for sure. Going out there and meeting people changed my mind. I realized that everyone has their own story and that there are a lot of reasons why someone might be homeless. Some people have mental health problems, some lost their jobs, and some just had really bad luck. It taught me that it's important to look beyond the surface and not just believe everything you hear. Talking to people and hearing their stories helped me see the truth.

Looking at things from both a small, personal perspective and a big, societal perspective has helped me understand things better. It's important to see the immediate needs and emotions, but it's also important to understand the larger context and the reasons behind things. This helps me appreciate how complex life is and how much we all depend on each other. 

The ideas of creation, fall, redemption, and hope give me a way to understand my place in the world just like my Imago Dei poster. Creation reminds me that everyone has value and potential. The fall acknowledges that things aren't always perfect and that there's a lot of brokenness. Redemption shows that there's always a chance for things to get better. And hope keeps me going, even when things are tough. I know that I'm not perfect, but I can keep learning, growing, and trying to make a positive impact on the world.
