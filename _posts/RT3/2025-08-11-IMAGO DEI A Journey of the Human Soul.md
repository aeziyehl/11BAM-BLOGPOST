I see my own story in my "Imago Dei" poster. Life is a journey of finding out who you are, and my poster shows this. It goes from a whole person at the top to a broken one in the middle, and then to a restored one at the bottom. This paper is about one part of my life that matches that journey. I'll explain how I went from a limited view to a full one, and from what I thought was true to what was actually true. This helped me get a clearer picture of my life's purpose.

My poster shows a glowing light inside a person's chest. This reminds me that I was created by God with dignity and purpose. But there's also a crack in the middle, and that represents the time I felt completely overwhelmed. I was carrying too many burdens at once. The pressure was so much that I thought I couldn't handle it. This moment pushed me past my normal limits. It made me see that I was more than just a body. It showed me my potential to rise above situations and find strength I didn't know I had.

At first, I only saw a small part of the problem, focusing on the feeling of being overwhelmed and the need to be perfect, which made me feel like a failure. But then my view changed to a larger, holistic one, a transition shown by the golden lines on my poster. I realized my value isn't about being perfect; being Imago Dei also means getting grace from God and help from the community around me, and this new view helped me handle situations with more wisdom.

The experience taught me the difference between a real truth and just my opinion. My opinion was that asking for help was a sign of weakness. But the truth, which I saw through my faith, youth, and my family, is that asking for help is actually a sign of strength. This realization was key to restoring my dignity and acting from a place of self-love instead of exhaustion. I learned to see myself not as a failure, but as a person who is eager to become his best version, who finds his strength through God. 

My poster is a daily reminder that we are created good, we fall, but we can be redeemed. In the bottom part, the figure is whole and connected to a community. This shows that when we choose truth over opinion and find strength in ourselves from others, we are truly living as the image of God. Living out the Imago Dei is a daily choice to see with God's eyes, to act with His heart, and to live a life full of faith, hope, and love. It has given me a clearer purpose and a deeper understanding of who I am as a human being.
