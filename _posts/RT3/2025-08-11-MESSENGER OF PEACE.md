When I was overweight, I spent a lot of time convincing myself that I was okay. I said to
myself that I was happy the way things were, that I could still lead a complete life without
doing anything to change. I kept myself occupied with activities like reading, playing chess,
and working on little creative endeavours. I assured myself that this was sufficient. But
deep inside, I knew I yearned for something else.

I wanted the sense of being able to run freely on the court, entering into basketball games
without always worrying about holding my teammates back or getting winded. I wanted to
be physically able to participate in any activity without wondering if my body would be
capable. The reality was, regardless of how much I attempted to embrace my condition, my
body kept me from the life I actually desired.

Then, something unexpected and life changing happened to me that I never anticipated.
One morning, I had to be taken to the hospital for an urgent appendectomy. The whole
experience was scary. In the operating room, surrounded by blinding lights and doctors, I
was spacing out of fear. At that blurred moment, I caught a glimpse of something that I
shall never forget: a dove.

It wasn't just a bird. It was like a message. To me, it was a sign of peace, rebirth, and hope.
It was as if the dove was saying to me that this wasn't the end, but the beginning of
something new. That imagery followed me long after the surgery, a soft whisper in my head
telling me that I could change, that I could walk into a new book if I wanted to.

When I recovered, I knew I could no longer continue living in my head, fantasizing about
my life but never doing anything to get to it. I decided that I would forget waiting for the
perfect moment and start taking action at the moment. I started lifting weights not only to
feel different but to gain actual strength. I resumed playing basketball, challenging myself
to run, jump, and move with the vitality I once envied in others.

The workouts were hard at first. I was sore, fat and hungry But each time I went on the
court or held a dumbbell in my hand, I felt slightly stronger. Each bead of sweat was
evidence that I was making progress. Gradually, my body began to keep up with the
fantasies I had been dreaming of for so long.

In conclusion, that experience with the dove is more precious to me now. It was not merely
a bizarre picture during surgery. It was a moment of transformation. It reminds me that
transformation is possible, that boundaries can be transcended, and that life has a way of
sending us messages when we need them most. Now I hold on to that memory as evidence

of being able to always overcome yesterday's version of me. I can be better, healthier, and
happier in my body, as well as in my spirit.
