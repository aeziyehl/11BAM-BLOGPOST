## I. INTRODUCTION

The story "Magnificence" was written by Estrella D. Alfon. The story focuses on a

young girl who becomes the target of a predator named Vicente who offered to help the the young girl and his brother generously lending them things they
desire especially the pencils yet behind those actions has hidden intentions. The story also shows how her mother steps in to save her. The learning lesson that we can carry and the heart of the story is that true "magnificence" is not about power. In choosing the right path even when we are trembling, there lives true courage. It’s serves as a reminder that our actions matter though how big or  small, good and bad, we share the same necessary responsibility to look out for the most vulnerable among us.

## II.SUMMARY

Estrella D. Alfon’s short story Magnificence tells the story of a Filipino mother who protects her young daughter after a trusted family friend betrays their trust inside the family home during the American colonial period in the Philippines. The conflict arises when the child is harmed, forcing the mother to confront evil not through violence but through moral restraint and decisive action. Alfon shows how true courage and strength emerge through self-control, maternal love, and ethical responsibility rather than impulsive revenge. The story explains why silence, blind obedience to authority, and concern for reputation values embedded in Filipino society at the time can enable injustice, especially against women and children. Using philosophical concepts of moral integrity, justice, and ethical choice, the narrative emphasizes that protecting the innocent requires awareness, vigilance, and
the courage to act rightly even in a flawed society.

## III. ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION

### A. BIOGRAPHICAL CONTEXT

Estrella D. Alfon was a Filipina writer known for writing about her everyday life, especially her
experiences as a woman. Many of her works focus on moral integrity and owning up to yourself.
In the work we were assigned, Magnificence, her ideas are channeled through the mother, who
deliberately chose to protect her instead of acting with violence. This reflects Alfon's views, showing that true strength and heroism come from self control, passion and the love she felt for
her children.

### B. LINGUISTIC CONTEXT
The language used in the given literary work is simple, direct, yet effective and controlled. The
author uses careful but calm words to show the active restraint of the mother, also proving that
she doesn't need to be stereotypically overdramatic. The calm tone shows that the mother is
practicing her restraint. She uses subtle descriptions instead of bold, strong emotions. The
story's language only adds to the magnificence of courage, discipline, love, and morality.
_Literary Themes_
The story explores maternal love, protection and trust. It displays how trust can be broken, but a
mother’s love never waives.
_Story Elements_
The main characters are the mother and her children. The family friend serves as an antagonist.
The setting is the family’s home. The conflict is when the family friend tries to harm the
daughter. The resolution is the mother protecting her child.
_Literary Techniques_
The author uses subtlety and less dramatic dialog to convey the restraint of the mother. The
author also potentially makes use of contrast between the somewhat disturbing events and the
calm, almost casual narration.
_Literary Genre_
It may fall under a realistic drama. It reflects very real and possible issues and experiences,
which makes the narrative all the more moving.

### C. SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT

The Sociocultural context of the story talks about the society and culture that are present in the Philippines during the American colonial period. In this context, Philippine society depended on Western ideas while still maintaining traditional concepts. The need for children to submit to adults blindly, especially within the family setting, is illustrated in the story through the character Vicente. His being an adult male meant that submission came immediately. The society’s values of submission and silence were such that it did not allow young girls to articulate their suffering. The story also highlights how Filipino culture regarded women and morality. Women were expected to be quiet and modest and speak properly, despite them being treated wrongly. The intervention of the children is postponed as the adults are more concerned about maintaining harmony and staying respectable rather than seeking truth and justice. The value placed on reputation over truth and justice is evident and brought out in this situation as Alfon highlights the dangers posed by such Filipino customs and calls the readers to think differently about such customs that allow things to go wrong.

## IV. CONCLUSION

Evil has been, and will be, one of the most prevalent subjects and topics of humanity: Estrella D. Alfon masterfully uses a deep human fear we all have, and instead of telling us
outright, she implies the abuse — letting our imagination take hold. The experiences of Estrella
D. Alfon as a woman in a patriarchal Filipino society shows in her works, the values of: justice,
moral integrity, and the need to stand up for those who cannot. The family is integral to Filipino
life, and the degradation of it in the story is central to how trust can be broken with devastating
consequences; the family friend showing themselves to be of ill-character and the subsequent
motherly love having to take action displays how we cannot just let evil and misdeeds take place
— we must take action to protect those we love. Human nature is never exempt from the
temptations of evil, even the people you trust and love can betray you for such vain and
sickening motives; human nature is always susceptible and very capable of great evil and misdeeds, we must stay vigilant: for our loved ones, and for ourselves.
