##  Introduction
The short story “Swaddling Clothes” written by Yukio Mishima focuses on childbirth,
motherhood, and the emotional distance that can exist between a mother and a
child. The story displays how fear, pain, and social expectations affect a woman
during and after birth, suggesting that motherhood does not always bring
instantaneous love, but would also harbor confusion and struggle.
## Summary
The story takes place in mid-20th century Tokyo, the story revolving on the main
lead, Toshiko, is a sensitive woman married to an actor who prioritizes style and
public image over genuine empathy. An inciting incident occurs when the family's live
-in nurse suddenly gives birth to an illegitimate child on the floor of their home.
Toshiko’s husband treats the event as a scandalous anecdote to tell his friends, but
Toshiko, on the other hand, is traumatized. To cover the “filth” of the birth, the doctor
wraps the newborn in swaddling clothes made of stained newspaper. Toshiko then
becomes obsessed over the child’s future, certain that twenty years later, the boy,
solidified by his poor upbringing, will cross paths with her own child to seek revenge.
The mixture of guilt and a strange desire for atonement drives Toshiko to wander into
Chidorigafuchi Park at night. There, she encounters a homeless youth, sleeping on a
bench who is wrapped in newspapers. In a final, ambiguous moment, she
approaches him, seemingly offering herself up to the destiny she has been wanting.
The story moves from a domestic and private interior, to a cold and public exterior,
which mirrors Toshiko’s shift from her internal anxiety to external confrontation with
reality. The author, Mishima, employs a rich, and sensory imagery, as the
newspapers are the central symbol; they represent the disposable nature of the poor
and the tarnish affecting the upper class’s pristine world. The contrast between the
insulated and soft barrier of Toshiko’s social class and the harsh, disposable nature
of the infant’s existence creates a sharp, stylistic duality. The story is then told
through a third-person limit point of view. By staying close to Toshiko’s internal
monologue, the author allows the readers to experience her growing paranoia and
the disconnection between her inner empathy and the callousness of her social
circle.
## Analysis and Interpretation
Swaddling Clothes describes the psychological dimension of childbirth outside the
physical reality, especially the role of social status and feelings of repression in
creating the fears of Toshiko, revealing a social evil rooted in class-based judgment.
Instead of making motherhood seem a natural process of nurturing, Mishima makes
it an anxiety-inducing experience and conscience-weighing burden. Toshiko has a
trauma not simply because she was able to witness the birthing of a nurse, but
because the society perceives the event as degradable and unclean, reinforcing this


social evil. The lack of feeling of being in pain by her husband is a matter of
expounded cry of how the upper social class is emotionally detached and hence their
views feel that pain does not have a bearing on social status.
Additionally, the story shows a “culture clash” between the traditional Japanese
values and Western modernization. Toshiko’s husband embraces western ideals,
often dressing in American clothes and caring more about his appearances than
empathy, which contrasts greatly with Toshiko’s traditional sensibilities. This clash
increases her anxiety, as the Western-influenced lifestyle is associated with moral
decline and the intrusion of violence into both domestic and public life. The
newspapers, garbage, and cherry blossoms are symbolisms on how the effects of
Western-driven modernization is causing the decline of traditional Japanese morals
and ethics, contributing to the persistence of social evil in modern society.
The recurrent sign of newspapers is a strong criticism of social inequality. Warmth
and protection are replaced by newspapers, which are supposed to be read and
discarded, and this is an indication of how the poor are treated so replaceable and
temporary. The baby covered with a stained newspaper is a symbol of life which has
already been neglected and the subsequent picture of the homeless young one
covered with the same piece of paper is the indicator of something inevitable.
Through this repetition Mishima suggests that it is the society rather than the
personal morality that continues to perpetuate the practices of suffering.
Toshiko is unnaturally guilty and powerless, as her paranoia over the future revenge
of the child depicts the internal impact of this social evil. Her fear is based on no
logic, but rather tacit knowledge of privilege and injustice. She transfers onto a child
her moral uneasiness by fantasizing about a violent confrontation she experiences in
several years. This mental conflict is further heightened by the fact that the location
is not a safe environment like her home but rather an open venue, which is
Chidorigafuchi Park to represent her exposure to the reality she has been keen to
avoid.
## Social Issue and Contemporary Relevance
The novel reveals the social problems of inequality of classes, absence of emotions,
and dehumanization of the marginalized that persist to find their roots in the story.
Mishima criticizes the way in which society decontaminates uneasiness by
concealing poverty instead of its resolution. The birth of the child by the nurse is
regarded as filthy not due to the process itself, but the fact that it disturbs the social
order. This is a reflection of the contemporary realities where the issues of
impoverishment and illegitimacy continue to be shrouded in shame and secrecy as
opposed to being interpreted.
The story also highlights the cultural impact of Western modernization, showing how
foreign influences can disrupt traditional Japanese values and moral standards. The


westernized lifestyle, represented through Toshiko’s husband and the artificial urban
environment, is linked to moral decay and the loss of subtlety in Japanese social
ethics. Cherry blossoms, a traditional symbol of purity and transience, are obscured
by garish modern decorations, symbolizing how Westernization has altered both the
physical and cultural landscape
In modern society, the story has not become obsolete because the marginalized
groups are subject to systemic neglect. The symbolic representation of newspapers
is comparable to the contemporary modes of disposability which include informal
labor, homelessness and inaccessibility to healthcare. The story of Mishima calls the
reader to doubt the capacity of social institutions to sanction inequality and abet the
disengagement of the privileged members of the community.
## Conclusion
Swaddling Clothes critiques the old concept of motherhood making it a complicated
emotional process with fear, guilt, and social pressure. Mishima reveals the ethical
results of privileges of a certain social class and lack of emotions using the
psychological downward curve of Toshiko. Through Toshiko’s internal struggle, the
story also highlights how social class shapes empathy and moral responsibility, and
how societal pressure can increase and intensify personal traumas. The theme of
the disposability and social neglect is again supported by the repetition of the image
of newspapers leaving the reader in a disturbing fact on the part of the society in
fostering injustice. At the same time, the story connects past social norms to
contemporary issues, such as poverty, homelessness, and marginalization, and the
cultural impact of Western modernization, showing that these problems still continue
until today. At the end of it all, the story is not provided with an end but readers must
address the unpleasant realities lurking under the veneer of social respectability. By
leaving an open ending, Mishima encourages reflection on social responsibility,
empathy, and the influence of privilege on human relationships.
