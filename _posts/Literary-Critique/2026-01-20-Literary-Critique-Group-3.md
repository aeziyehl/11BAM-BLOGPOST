## I. Introduction
The Last Days of Magic by Ian R. Casocot is a short story, which depicts the village that
slowly loses the belief, traditions and mutual responsibility. It follows the young boy
Kulas, who is the one who is sensitive to the magic that used to form his society, at the
same time the adults reject the magical world. The village too physically and socially
falls apart as the faith declines.
According to this criticism, magic in the story by Casocot represents communal
recollection and ethical obligation. The story illustrates how social cohesion is destroyed
in societies that no longer think collectively, socialize, and embrace moral responsibility,
on the grounds of collective consciousness, socialization, as well as moral
responsibility.
## II. Summary
The play revolves around a boy called Kulas who resided in the village where magic
was the order of the day. Through time, the villagers lose their faith in magic and
dismiss it as useless. The loss of belief leads to the breakdown of the village, and
nobody is ready to accept the blame of the deterioration.
The story is about the conflict between Kulas and adults: the former wants to maintain
magic, and the adults do not pay attention to him. The story shows how cultural
practices are gradually being lost through this fight and also shows the philosophical
fact that the meaning and cohesion can only last as long as people take initiatives to
ensure that they are upheld.


## III. Interpretation and Analysis.
### A. Biographical Context
Ian R. Casocot is another Filipino writer and his work tends to address the theme of
memory, loss and connection to place. As he writes in a postcolonial Philippine, he
explores modernization and updating new social conditions and more particularly the
loss of tradition.
Magic in the Last Days of Magic is disappearing in a manner similar to culture in the
communities that do not appreciate their culture. According to the biography, Casocot
used to be familiar with the dangers of forgetting the past: it causes moral and social
corruption, which is a symptom of larger social problems in modern Filipino life.
### B. Linguistic Context
Literary Themes
The loss of culture, faith, responsibility as well as that of innocence are examined in
contrast to the adult authority in the story. Magic is a representation of shared traditions
and values among the community; its loss is rather an issue of moral sterility, but not
nature. This philosophically makes sense as collective responsibility and the social
construction of meaning and demonstrates how mutual beliefs support social cohesion.
Story Elements
Kulas is the most important character as the morally aware and conscious person when
his age will be opposed to the indifference of the adults. The village is a kind of allegory
of society: its falling is a reflection of the loss of the common values and cooperation. In
this story, the theme of responsibility underscores the irony of the most vulnerable being
the ones that have to shoulder the burden of morality.
Literary Genre
The Last Days of Magic belongs to the Fantasy genre, given that magic is used as a
part of the reality of the story, and it is not an incredible spectacle. It is also aimed at the
Young Adult audience, the protagonist is a child, the language is understandable, and
deeply social and philosophical issues are tackled. This blend prompts the readers
especially young generations to contemplate on responsibility, faith and cultural
conservation.


Literary Techniques
Magic Realism is used in Casocot, enforcing magic in a daily routine, emphasizing that
the systems of belief are socially constructed. Minimalism influences the language of
the story by offering events in a straightforward manner without any interpretation to the
reader and reflecting on the emotional coldness of the people in the village. The story is
also mirrored in a Paranoia technique, that is, the community downplaying any visible
evidence of decay, the failure of society to accept the reality of common neglect and its
effects.
### C. Sociocultural Environment (UCSP-oriented)
Social Issue
The novel points at the loss of culture and the deterioration of communal ethical
accountability.
Impact
This concern influences people as it undermines their identity and responsibility
aspects. The loss of tradition and common values in the family can lead to its
disintegration and the whole society might face the danger of social disintegration and
debasement.
Evidence
Villagers reject magic and consider it to be insignificant in the text and this diminishes
physical and social disintegration in the village. Social scientific studies have
demonstrated that societies that do not support common cultural practices tend to have
less social capital, less cooperation and ineffective social networks (Putnam, 2000).
The Urgent Need to Address the Problem.
Social cohesion as well as moral accountability cannot be maintained without collective
values. Neglecting cultural memory may render any society neglected and in decay like
Casocot depicts.
Recommendations
Individuals: Particles that are involved in cultural preservation should actively
participate in the preservation by means of storytelling, educational processes and
communal involvement.


Society: Organize cultural education and community programs to strengthen common
values.
Social Science Basis: Ideas in sociology, especially, collective consciousness
(Durkheim) prove that common beliefs maintain societal stability. The story and
research findings highlight the need to be conscious to maintain a given culture.
## IV. Conclusion
In The Last Days of Magic, the author demonstrates the need to unite society
collectively and through moral responsibility. The story of Casocot tells us that failure to
observe common principles results in death and destruction. The narrative brings the
question to the mind of readers as to their part in the conservatism of cultural practices
and ethical duty. Through collective values, the individuals as well as the society can
maintain social stability and continuity to avoid erosion of morality and culture.
