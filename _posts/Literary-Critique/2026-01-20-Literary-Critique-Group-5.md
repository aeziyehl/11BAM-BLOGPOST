## INTRODUCTION:
“Taya” is a 8:45 minute short film created by Adi Bontuyan and Francis Beltejar released
on youtube in 2013. This film explores the themes of poverty and innocence in a harsh
environment. Taya shows that no matter what happens, there is always Hope when we have
each other to go through tough times in our lives.
## SUMMARY:
“Taya” a short film by Adi Bontuyan and Francis Beltejar follows a young boy named Junjun who
just moved into a squatter community in Quezon City. He tries to settle into this new
environment by making new friends and playing traditional Filipino street games like Bangsak
and Bente-Uno. These games feel lively and innocent but quietly mirror real struggles
experienced by others around them. It’s set in a modern urban slum where the children’s games
and playing is suddenly interrupted by the brewing threat of relocation and demolition of their
homes. Even with that looming thought they return to their games again and again showing how
the games they play seem to help them cope with loss and uncertainty. The story is mostly told
through visual storytelling rather than dialogue and the short film uses the contrast between the
children’s carefree play and harsh reality to illustrate how cultural practices and childlike
imagination can offer a kind of resilience. The short film blends the simple structure of the
children’s games with the bleak structural pressures of poverty so that the viewer feels both joy
and unease during the duration of the film.
## 1st Paragraph - Biographical (life of the author)
Adi Bontuyan is a Filipino filmmaker and creative professional who earned his degree in
Communication Arts from De La Salle University. During his time as a student, he was an active
member of the campus press at De La Salle University’s official English student publication and
served as the photo editor of _The Lasallian_. Adi Bontuyan has produced several videos on the
internet that have reached millions of views. He first gained significant recognition when his
undergraduate thesis film _‘Taya’_ became a finalist at the 2013 Cinemalaya Independent Film
Festival. This short film was made to highlight social issues like the reality of urban poverty and
land demolition by using traditional Filipino games as metaphors for reality. Outside of
filmmaking, Adi Bontuyan creates popular videos and works as a professional photographer and
digital content creator. Now, Adi Bontuyan is also starting his own website and business while


balancing his freelance work. By learning about his background, we readers can understand the
gap between childhood innocence and the complex social struggles faced by communities in
the Philippines.
## 2nd Paragraph - Linguistic (formalistic theory)
The Literary Technique used in the short film “Taya” by Adi Bontuyan is Minimalism. Minimalism
are short, slice-of-life stories where the readers have to use their imagination. This is most
evident through Temporal Distortion in the ending part of the film, where we have an abrupt
jump one year into the future after the event. And by fragmenting the timeline, the filmmakers
force us viewers to imagine what had happened to the children within the year.
Additionally, the film employs a sense of playfulness or Dark Humor by framing life-threatening
situations, such as fleeing from a demolition crew, as mere extensions of traditional games. This
creates a sense of Hyperreality, where the boundaries between a game and real life become so
blurred that the children can no longer distinguish between the two. The stakes of the game
become the stakes of survival, which makes the play feel dangerously real and the reality feel
like an unending game.
## 3rd Paragraph - Sociocultural (relevance of the context society and culture)
The main social issue in “Taya” by Adi Bontuyan is Poverty and Displacement, where the
struggle of informal settlers are facing forced evictions. The film shows how poor families living
in impoverished areas are constantly at risk of losing their homes to government demolitions or
natural disasters like floods. By using traditional games to represent these hardships, the film
makes us realize the painful reality where the poor are always in a game “Taya” (It), where they
are always being chased, and security is always out of reach.
In the short film Taya, the issue of poverty and displacement shows how quick a family’s sense
of security can be taken away. This issue affects us by highlighting the fear of losing our homes,
friends, and the struggle to stay together when facing financial hardships in life. For society, it
reveals a sad reality where the poor are treated like targets in a game and constantly forced to
move just to make room for new buildings. Lastly, it reminds us that while families are resilient,
everyone deserves a stable place to live without the constant threat of being moved out.
At the beginning of the film, it foreshadows the forced displacement by briefly showing a part of
the news where it stated that the residents were informed but still refused to leave. At the
climax, it is shown that the residents and the government people are fighting for the area,
refusing to leave it. The streets were crowded with people, and there were scenes where people
were fighting back against the police, but evidently failed.


In the short film Taya, addressing displacement is necessary because it exposes the jarring
disconnect between the innocence of childhood and the brutal systemic realities of urban
poverty. By using traditional games as a metaphor for survival, the film reminds us that poverty
and forced displacement are not just economic issues. It is an issue of human right concerns.
When families live in constant fear of eviction, it affects children’s mental health, education, and
overall well-being.
## Conclusion:
In conclusion, “Taya” a short film by Adi Bontuyan presents a powerful reflection on how
childhood innocence clashes with harsh social realities. Through understanding Adi Bontuyan’s
background, it can be seen how his personal journey shaped the narrative that bridges childlike
play and protest. The minimalistic style and dark humor of the film compel the viewers to be
actively engaged in the story as these literary techniques make the reality of poverty and
displacement feel more intimate and unsettling. Socioculturally, Taya displays how societies
normalize the constant chasing and eviction faced by urban poor, treating their lives as
inessential pieces in a larger system. When viewed on a human level the film reveals resilience
and adaptability but also how the need for survival can blur moral and emotional boundaries.
Culturally it serves as a reminder that traditional symbols of joy and community can be
transformed to represent a message for suffering when social systems fail. Ultimately this short
film calls on individuals and society to recognize these struggling lives as shared responsibilities
that demand empathy rather than distant issues. Taya exhibits that those who struggle under
the weight of social systems deserve awareness and action toward justice and proper humane
living conditions.
