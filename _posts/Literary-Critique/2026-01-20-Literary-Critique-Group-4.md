## I. INTRODUCTION

Something feels off from the start in "ALALA" by Jayson Gamelo, though
everything seems like home. A man wakes up inside walls he recognizes, yet unease
creeps in without warning. Outside, kids laugh and run across the grass - ordinary
enough, except it sharpens the cracks in his thoughts. Clarity arrives in pieces: his
spouse died years ago, and he is not breathing, not really alive at all. What remains of
him sticks around through sheer refusal to disappear. Memory acts like glue here,
holding together moments that should have fallen apart. Emotion stretches time, making
ghosts out of people who never left emotionally. Reality blurs where longing refuses to
release its grip. Staying stuck becomes its own kind of afterlife. Letting go does not
happen, so neither does moving on. Existence, seen through existential thought,
reveals a figure detached, drifting beyond self-recognition or clear intent.
Consciousness becomes the architect of his world when viewed phenomenologically -
experience molds reality so deeply that perception can drift far from factual ground.

## II. SUMMARY

A sudden chill greets him as the front door creaks open, morning light spilling
across floorboards worn smooth by time. Outside, laughter bounces between trees
where two kids toss a ball without noticing his slow approach. One turns, squints, then
asks why he talks like someone from an old recording. His questions come carefully,
shaped by habit rather than hope, each answer stitching together fragments of what
slipped away. Long pauses hang after every reply they offer about the house being
different now, remodeled twice since the fire. Mention of her name - his wife’s - is met
with silence before one child adds she's in pictures upstairs, beside a box labeled
"Grandpa." Words stop mattering at that point; instead, it sinks in slowly, carried less by
speech than the weight behind their eyes. What felt real - the routine, the love, the
sense of continuity - wasn’t kept alive beyond memory. Stillness returns when
understanding arrives: belonging ended when breath did. A person's experience unfolds
not as a fixed truth but is shaped by how they recall and sense their surroundings.
Because past moments linger, identity forms slowly through those fragments. Isolation
appears when inner life drifts apart from shared reality. Meaning does not arrive easily -
it emerges unevenly amid confusion and silence. When attachment grows too tight
around what once was, moving forward becomes harder than staying still. What feels
like holding on may actually be letting go of now.

## III. ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION

### A. BIOGRAPHICAL CONTEXT

“Alaala” by Jason Gamelo can be analyzed as a poem about how
memories affect a person’s life. Although the poem may be inspired by the poet’s
own experiences, it also reflects feelings that many people can relate to. In the
poem, memories act as a connection between the bygone and the present. It
shows that bygone experiences continue to influence a person’s emotions and
actions. The poem suggests that remembering is not always easy, because
memories can bring both happiness and sadness. Some memories give comfort,
while others cause pain. The poem also shows how memories help people
remember crucial persons, places, and moments in their lives. These memories
stay yet when those people or moments are no longer present. Through
remembering, a person can better understand who they are and where they
came from. Memories also help people learn from their bygone experiences.
Overall, “Alaala” presents memory as a powerful and spontaneous part of human
life that goes beyond the poet’s subjective story.
B. LINGUISTIC CONTEXT

#### Literary Themes

The poem focuses on the themes of history and memory, showing how the
bygone is never gone. The first theme illustrates that the bygone experiences
serve as the foundation of the character’s identity, shaping how they think, act,
and understand the world today. The writer emphasizes that remembering is not
just about recalling events, but recognizing how those events continue to impact
the present. The second theme highlights that memory is personal and
emotional, meaning it is influenced by personal perspective rather than being a
list of plain facts. Ultimately, the analysis argues that because feelings and
biases color our recollections, each person creates their own deeply personal
version of the bygone.

#### Story Elements

The analysis identifies "Lolo" as the independent protagonist who is a
round but static character, spell the grandchild, and children are depicted as
minor, flat characters. The story is set in a mundane Filipino home where the
companion surroundings act as temperamental triggers that shift the narrator's
focus between the present and the past. This quiet and modest environment
serves to reflect the narrator's lingering feelings of sadness and longing. The
plot's exposition begins with the narrator waking up to prepare for church with his
wife, Jane, only to encounter unsettling events within their home. Specifically, he
notices a strange person in the house and becomes distressed when he realizes
his wife is not responding to him.

#### Literary Techniques

The poem"Alaala" strongly employs temporal distortion and paranoia to
heighten its sentimental impact and deepen its meaning. Moreover, the narrator's
memory loss fractures his sense of time, forcing him to live in a present reality
that feels unknown and hollow. This distortion highlights how identity relies on
memory, becoming especially hard when the narrator fails to recognize his own
home and family. Paranoia emerges as an archaic response to this confusion,
causing the narrator to question the intentions and identities of the people about
him despite their familiarity. Ultimately, these techniques work together to
immerse the reader in the narrator's fear and isolation, making his struggle feel
ambient and profoundly human.

#### Literary Genres

The poem aligns with the existing genre through its central theme of
"History and Memory," which posits that historic experiences serve as the
essential foundation for the character's current identity. By employing temporary
distortion, the narrative often shifts focus away from the present, immersing the
reader in a version of the historic that is triggered by fellow ordinary
surroundings. This connection emphasizes that history in the story is not only a
record of apparent facts, but also an unverifiable and emotional landscape that
directly influences how the protagonist understands the world. The text argues

that remembering is an important act of recognizing how these effective events
continue to actively affect the present moment, rather than barely unusual as
reserved for recollections. Ultimately, the story illustrates the annihilative
consequences of being disconnected from one's private history, showing that
without these memories, the present feels hollow and the character's sense of
self fractures completely.

### C. SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT

The sociocultural context of the story addresses the rational health of the
aged and transmissible bonds within Filipino culture. The independent highlight is
the protagonist's memory deterioration, a familiar symptom of aging. This is
captured when he asks his own children who they were, showing a struggle to
recognize his own family and surroundings.
Dementia is the gregarious issue identified here, representing a disease
that affects memory and behavior. In the Philippines, this affects around 10.6% of
people over age 60. The text applies the concept of time, which suggests that
humans go through necessary changes and reach carnal and rational limits as
time passes. This issue affects me by challenging my understanding of identity,
affects families through the sentimental strain of caregiving, and affects society
by increasing the demand for technical healthcare.
The story emphasizes the Filipino ethnic value of adjacent family bonds.
Unlike in many Western cultures where the elderly might be moved to nursing
homes, the line “Kami po ang mga apo nyo at ang mga tao sa loob ay mga anak
nyo” points to a multi-generational household. This reflects the sociological
concept of Intersubjectivity, the idea that humans are social beings who thrive
through connection and "being with others." The grandchildren’s intervention
provides the grandpa with awareness, proving that connection is important for
those suffering from memory loss.

## IV. CONCLUSION

Jason Gamelo’s "Alaala" offers a fundamental meditation on memory not
merely as a record of the past, only as the frail architect of identity and personal reality. Through an experiential lens, the narrative depicts the tragic isolation
caused by memory deterioration, anchoring this struggle within the special
context of the close Filipino family and the sociological concept of
intersubjectivity— the idea that the self is fundamentally sustained by others.
Beyond an easy narrative, the story serves as a persuasive call to action, urging
readers to recognize family bonds as indispensable rational anchors rather than
simple traditions. Ultimately, it argues that constant memory is settled not by
lonely recollection, only by the shared love and reassurance found in the active,
caring embrace of family, thereby necessitating a deeper social commitment to
caring for the aged and their rational health.
