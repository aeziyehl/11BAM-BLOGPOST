This artwork is a vibrant and heartfelt expression of faith, combining powerful Christian symbols to convey a deep spiritual message. The image is divided into three main sections, each with its own rich symbolism. At the top, we see a yellow background with a blue dove at the center—a classic representation of the Holy Spirit. The dove, often depicted descending during the baptism of Jesus, reminds us of God’s constant presence, guidance, and peace in our lives. Its open wings symbolize readiness to protect, bless, and guide believers, while the bright yellow background can be seen as a sign of hope, joy, and divine light.

To the left, there is a globe encircled by a rosary. This detail speaks strongly of the universal call to prayer, unity, and devotion. The rosary is not merely a Catholic tradition—it is a spiritual weapon of peace, a repetitive meditation on the life of Jesus through the intercession of Mary. The globe signifies the world, and the rosary wrapped around it implies that prayer has the power to unite all nations, heal divisions, and bring humanity closer to God. The small cross hanging from the rosary reinforces the centrality of Christ’s sacrifice for the salvation of the world.

The lower part of the drawing transitions into purple, a color often associated with penitence, preparation, and the season of Lent. In the center, we find a large cross-like structure with a heart at its core—possibly representing the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The Sacred Heart is a powerful reminder of Christ’s unconditional love for humanity, burning with compassion and mercy. The heart’s central placement shows that love is at the very center of the Christian faith, radiating outward to all corners of the world. It is framed by geometric shapes and additional crosses, which could symbolize the different ways faith branches out into our lives—through service, kindness, and sacrifice.

The bottom section of the image is shaded in soft orange, giving the feeling of earth, grounding, and warmth. This may symbolize the connection between heaven and earth, the divine and the human. The design as a whole flows from heavenly light at the top (yellow), to spiritual reflection and sacrifice in the middle (purple), and finally to earthly living and mission at the bottom (orange). This progression suggests that faith begins with God’s light, transforms us through prayer and repentance, and ultimately sends us out to live as witnesses in the world.

In reflecting on this artwork, one can see it as a call to integrate prayer, love, and the Holy Spirit into daily life. The rosary challenges us to pray not just for personal needs but for the world. The Sacred Heart calls us to love selflessly. The dove encourages us to let the Spirit lead our words and actions. Together, these symbols form a spiritual roadmap: connect with God in prayer, open your heart to His love, and allow His Spirit to guide you as you bring light and peace to others. This piece is not just colorful—it is alive with meaning, a visual sermon that reminds us of the beauty and depth of faith
