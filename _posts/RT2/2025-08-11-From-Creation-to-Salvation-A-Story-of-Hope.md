This poster illustrates the four stages: Creation, Fall, Redemption, and Hope. In the top left, it depicts the Creation of the Earth and Universe,showing God forming all things in six days. The top right portrays the Fall of humanity Showing Adam and Eve sharing the fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, with the serpent coiled around it symbolizing temptation and disobedience. In the bottom left shows Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, representing Redemption and God’s grace extended to mankind. Finally, the bottom right shows the message of Hope in Christianity, a confident expectation of salvation and eternal life through Jesus Christ.

I consider myself an overthinker, and there was a point in my life when my thoughts became my greatest enemy. I was at my lowest, lowered down by personal problems and a deep sense of being worthless. I doubted my abilities, skills, and talents, believing I could never reach my goals or improve myself. Every attempt I make to be better always seemed to fail, leaving me stuck in the same place. This experience taught me an important truth, problems are temporary and can be solved if you are willing to face them with determination and faith. I realized that overthinking only leads to negativity, so I  counter my negative thoughts with possibilities, what I can do, and who I can become. This shift gave me a deeper understanding of myself and life. Every problem has an answer, and every question has a solution waiting to be found.

At first, I saw my struggles as an unchangeable part of who I was, and I labeled myself as lazy and incapable. But when I tried to truly understand my situation, I realized that change was possible if I was willing to act. Observing and thinking of how others handled their problems inspired me to adopt a more holistic view of life. This perspective helped me see that my challenges were not fixed limitations but opportunities for growth. A partial view only gives a small understanding, but a holistic view allows you to connect and understand your experiences, reflect deeply. By taking up this mindset, I learned to focus not only on my failures but on the potential things I can do that lie within me.

Through reflection, I have discovered that many of the beliefs I held about myself were not facts but opinions because of my negative overthinking. Change happened when I decided I could no longer accept that I am this kind of person and not accept that I will be like this in the future. Seeking the truth about myself meant going beyond simply following instructions, it meant actively searching for understanding and solutions. This journey of seeking truth has helped me grow, not just by showing me what I needed to change, but by teaching me how to take action toward becoming a better version of myself. Today, I carry with me the conviction that with faith, determination, and the right perspective, I can face life’s challenges with courage and hope.
