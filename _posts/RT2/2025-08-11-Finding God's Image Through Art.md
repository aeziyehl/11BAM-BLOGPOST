A poster is more than mere simple lines, arranged colors and shapes on a page. A poster is a form of art, and art is more than just a picture, it is a way of telling a story, conveying a message, it is art. A poster can capture the artist’s values, ideas, and beliefs in a way that is memorable and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer. As the viewer, our job is to look deeper at the meaning behind these artworks, to respect the feelings and emotions inside each poster. As an art form, it certainly serves as a challenge for the artist to create something meaningful, requiring critical thinking and careful reflection. The artist needs to know what they wish to convey in their artwork, or else the final product may be a result with several disconnected meanings. In our CLF performance task, the Imago Dei related poster served not only as an artistic project but also as a space for deep personal and philosophical reflection. I have found out many things about myself and the nature of humanity in general. It invited me to explore the themes of dignity, brokenness, and redemption through imagery that resonates with both the heart and the mind. Upon doing so, I realized something important; the poster was no mere creative output. It became a means of how I feel about human nature as a whole, and it allowed me to express my appreciation for God. It allowed me to believe in faith, and hope for restoration to a time where humanity was purer.

When I created my Imago Dei poster, I did not feel like I was just completing a task for CLF, it felt like I was engaging in a process that felt holy and divine, it felt like being a human, if that makes sense. It made me think about how I wanted to express myself and my love for God. As a person, I carry dignity and flaws. I was created in His image, but was still affected by the sins of the past and my lack of self-preservation. Visually representing these ideas proved to be difficult, I was held back by my lack of capabilities to draw competently. However, I did my best to comply with the deadlines and to convey my ideas to the best of my abilities. 

The poster reminded me that we were capable of fulfilling our needs and transcending, as long as we have God by our side at all times in our lives. Even as students, we can create something that speaks to others, inspire reflection, and invoke hope. By choosing Imago Dei as our symbol of grace, restoration, and our purpose. I acknowledged the belief that humans are called to rise above selfish desires and live for something greater.


The project showed me the importance of seeing the bigger picture and to ‘empty my cup’ from time to time. Rather than focusing only on the artistic side or the theological side, I learned to integrate both, letting both flow into each other seamlessly to create an output that had my passion and feelings inside it. This balance helped me understand that real wisdom comes from passion, experience, respecting core values, and emotion. In the end, my poster became a reflection not just of the Imago Dei theme, but also of my perspective on life with God’s presence. 

The Imago Dei poster ended up becoming more than a project or a requirement. It was a given opportunity to express my beliefs, acknowledge my limitations, and to reflect on myself. Through all of this, I realized that Philosophy and CLF isn’t only found in books or discussions, but are also present in the choices we make when we create, understand, and share our work. Overall, this experience strengthened my appreciation for Imago Dei and deepened my awareness.  And most importantly, it reminded me that in every creative act, no matter how small or ambitious, can be a reflection of one’s reflections and raw emotions, no matter the level of talent, art and posters will always be a form of expression.
