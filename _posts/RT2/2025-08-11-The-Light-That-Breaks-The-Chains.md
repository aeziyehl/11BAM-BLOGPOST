I recall in 7th grade, I was an extremely lazy person—I wouldn’t work on anything and told myself I wasn’t capable of exceeding my limits. My motivation was low, and my drive was nonexistent. Everyone except me knew that I was capable of more—they were disappointed seeing my potential go to waste. 8th grade was fast approaching, and I didn’t know how to handle it—would it be worse, would it be better? I didn’t know it at the time, but my life would change drastically from how it was back then. 

The first day came, and I was anxious—I didn’t even want to go to school, yet my instincts told me it would be worth it. I remember arriving in the room and seeing all my classmates’ faces, and I breathed out a sigh of relief—maybe it wouldn’t be so bad after all. As time passed, I started to have fun, and each time I thought to myself, “This was the right decision.” Throughout the ups and downs, one person supported me and enabled me to see myself in a new light; this person was my English teacher at the time, Ms. Seville. Although she was strict, I knew that she was strict because she saw the potential that I didn’t see within myself. 

Eventually, 9th grade came, and I was still lazy, but I knew for sure this time I would try harder—maybe I could even achieve honors. However, the moment I stepped into the classroom, the atmosphere was different—it was outlandish, and I didn’t feel comfortable with it. Life then was a mix of emotions; it was fun, exciting, chaotic, and even depressing. Despite my laziness and the kind of classroom I was in, my grades increased, and I was proud of myself—this wouldn’t last long, however. In the second quarter, I ended up breaking ties with a good friend of mine at the time. Naturally, I struggled to find the excitement within my life, and boom. I was hit with a harsh grade of 79 due to the slump that devoured me. My dream of honors was gone, and my heart was shattered. All I could think of at that time was, “I’ll do better next time, I promise.” It never stopped repeating in my head, even until now. 


After the amount of traumatizing events I witnessed, I decided I would turn to a greater power, someone who knows more than I ever will—God. I prayed and prayed and prayed that I would become a person who exceeded his limits—a person who went above and beyond. Soon, it was evident that my prayers were answered. I eventually stopped being lazy and started being productive—I realized I could surpass my limits. I wasn’t limited by the world—I was limited by who I thought I was. 

10th grade came, and the words “I’ll do better next time, I promise,” still echoed through my head. This time, I knew for a fact that I would surpass who I was and live my life like I’d never have before. For the first time in my life, I’d felt like I could be something—that I’d transcended. It felt like my body and soul had worked together to achieve greatness. This time, I wasn’t limited to who I thought I was anymore—I thought I couldn’t be limited by anything at the time. Through sleepless nights, painstaking hours of studying, and dedication, I’d ended the school year with Honors. I was proud of myself, but even more proud were those who supported me through my journey. 

This led me to realize that life isn’t about who you think you could be—it’s about surpassing who you think you could be. Life isn’t always sunshine and rainbows; hardships are always felt, but it’ll all be worth it in the end because from those hardships you live through and learn from them. Yet, some miss the fact that hardships are for learning; they think that because of one hardship, it’s over. That’s how I used to think as well, but I tell you, the hardships you face are the excellence that you will achieve in the future. Lastly, acknowledging that you do not have the power to do things by yourself is essential for surpassing your limits; one must realize that it is those around you who support you that help you understand yourself truly. For me, it was my family, friends, and teachers—they were the light that broke my chains.
