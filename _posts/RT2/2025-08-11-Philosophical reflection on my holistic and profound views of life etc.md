We all have moments in our lives where we feel alone – fighting battles by ourselves where it seems it will never end, but sometimes it eventually does. However, at the end of each battle, it is apparent that you must solve whatever weakness you find that made that battle hard. Otherwise, you’ll keep fighting these intense, never ending battles until you burn out of exhaustion – so yeah. Fix weaknesses, very important. An example from my life right now would be these quarterly tests. I’m struggling right now, but not as much as I would have without my horrible past experiences with getting single digit scores to learn from. The mistakes I’ve made and learnt from; That, I’m grateful for. 

However, in that process of learning from my mistakes with not studying for my quarterly exams. I thought of “could I apply this to my actual life”. Could I apply solving for my internal and external weaknesses to transcend whatever limitation was imposed on me, could I achieve higher than just what had to be done? Yes, I could. 

Analyzing myself, from my point of view, to even other’s points of views. I could spot them – my weaknesses. My mindset, how I presented myself, etc. Understanding what I could spot and acting upon whatever I was able to spot as well were even more pieces to the puzzle.

Another moment in my life I would like to bring up, would be starting up my fitness journey. I had all the reasons to not even start in the first place: “This is going to be tiring”, It’s not worth the effort, it will take too long“, “I’m just small, no point in getting stronger”. However, despite those reasons I started anyway – I pushed through whatever reasons my mind and body threw at me, and I just started anyway. The result was lifechanging, and it has taught me so much lessons about pushing through your bodily and your mind’s limits.

Once, I started. I felt like I was truly striving for something past “just getting stronger” – It was an unexplainable feeling of aiming towards this goal rather than just a more muscular body. That experience was truly enriching both my body and soul as a whole, and why I still take my fitness and exercise seriously because of its effects on my personal and spiritual growth.

It also didn’t only affect me as well. With my experiences regarding my own fitness and exercise journey: I’ve made friends, helped/inspired people, and strengthened my existing relationships. 
All because of the lessons it had taught me, weaknesses it had fixed, everything. In the process of my fitness journey, I was able to find purpose and meaning in forming relationships and interacting with different people. It wasn’t just exercise, It changed my life.

For other people, this inlet doesn’t have to be fitness. It could be their job, hobby, or the internet. Anything that gives them these types of experiences could work. Mine just so happens to be exercise.
