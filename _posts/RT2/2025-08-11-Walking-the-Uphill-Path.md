My CLF poster is a visual journey of the human story through the lens of Imago Dei. At the center, a hand reaches outward with an orb of light, and the orb creating Man. This depicts that all people are born and created in God’s image, with dignity and purpose. A flowing blue pathway winds upward into a staircase, represent that we all have a path towards God. Along this path are scenes that reflect the beauty of creation, our responsibility in taking care of God’s creation, that we at times fall away and go back to God, the saving grace of redemption, and hands that represents to sides of man. The side where there is hesitation and a side where we completely reach out and make an effort despite the struggles and sacrifices.

One of the biggest personal connections I created in this poster is between the two hands reaching upward with one hand hesitating and the other completely reaching out, an experience I had when I felt distant from God and others. It happened throughout my time in school. When I struggled with academic pressure, family pressure, and my own self-doubt. It felt as if I was walking uphill with shaky legs, wondering whether or not if I was moving forward or simply standing still. This was my “fall,” not because of one dramatic failure, but because of the slow, heavy weight of discouragement that made me forget the goodness of creation and the hope of redemption.

At first, my view of the situation was narrow and emotional. I thought I was someone that had nothing good, thinking I couldn’t and wouldn’t be able to do anything for myself or the people around me. My mindset at the time was that my self worth and usefulness depended on whether or not I could get this grade and get applauded for doing such things. This perspective blinded me and hurt me in a way in seeing who I actually was and who I would be in God’s image. I forgot that we humans have limits it was never about achievement but also about building relationship, your connection to people, and your deep and strong relationship with God.

But with time, and with fervent prayer, my eyes were opened to the nigger world. Conversing with people that actually had my back reminded me that even in my failures and lowest, I still carried the image of God. This image was not erased by stress or imperfection. This shift in perspective was like stepping back from my poster and seeing all its parts together. The hand of God in the center came to mean God’s steady presence, even when I felt apart from Him, He was still there. The blue staircase reminded me that the process is as important as the result, and that God is present through each careful and slow step, even at time where we are lost.

This experience also helped me separate truth from opinion. I once thought that the damage can never be repaired, and that what has been done is done. In reality, that was only an opinion rooted in fear. The truth, which I discovered through a long and deep reflection, was that my worth is constant because I am made in God’s image. Psalm 130:7, which I included in my poster, speaks of placing our hope in the Lord because His love and redemption are unfailing. That truth became an anchor during my lowest moments. 

What made this experience transformative was the transcendence it called me to. I was not simply trying to feel better or succeed again. I was learning to aim for something higher, to live as someone who reflects God’s love in both strength and weakness. Like the puzzle pieces in my poster, I saw how my joys, failures, and relationships fit together in God’s larger design.

As ai gaze over at my poster as I am now I see the bigger picture. I see my own story, created through journey of ups and downs. My vision of life is no longer about avoiding mistakes but about living each moment aware of God’s image within me and in others. To live in Imago Dei is to remember that every step on the path, whether overshadowed or seen, leads to the Lord God
